Here are **resume-ready bullets**, ordered from **most impactful** to **most technical**.
You can use **one** (preferred) or **two** max — any more dilutes signal.

---

### ⭐ Primary Resume Bullet (VP-Credible, Highly Recommended)

**Designed and built a cloud-native public-data lakehouse on AWS to identify childcare deserts in Massachusetts at ZIP-code level, integrating Census demand data, state licensing supply data, geospatial boundaries, and analytics engineering with dbt to produce executive-ready insights.**

---

### 🔧 Secondary Resume Bullet (Technical Depth, Optional)

**Implemented an end-to-end ELT pipeline using S3, Parquet, Athena, AWS Glue, and dbt, including geospatial joins at ZCTA level, data quality testing, and a reusable analytical mart supporting dashboards and AI-assisted explanations.**

---

### 🧠 If You Want a Director/VP-Tone Variant (More Strategy, Less Tools)

**Led the design of a scalable data platform leveraging public demographic, licensing, and geospatial data to quantify childcare supply-demand gaps, enabling expansion, investment, and policy analysis without reliance on proprietary data.**

---

### ❌ What NOT to Do

Avoid bullets like:

* “Built dashboards using Power BI”
* “Used Python and SQL”
* “Created ETL pipelines”

Those undersell what this project actually demonstrates.

---

### 📌 Placement Recommendation

Put this under:

* **Projects** section, or
* **Selected Architecture Projects**, or
* **Data Platforms & AI Systems** (great for VP resumes)
